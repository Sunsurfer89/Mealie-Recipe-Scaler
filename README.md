# Mealie-Recipe-Scaler
A simple HTML Tool to scale a Mealie recipe using the JSON data format.

## The story behind
I'm a proud dad of two adorable little girls 🥰 and — who would have guessed — kids eat. *A lot!* 😵 And that’s just how it should be! 👍 But it’s important to us that our children don’t grow up eating only pasta. We want them to enjoy a wide variety of meals. 🥗🥪🌮🥩🥘🍲🍌🍇🍎🥒🥦🥕

Since we both enjoy cooking and also like things to run as smoothly as possible, we discovered [Mealie](https://mealie.io/) a while ago. It's not just where we store our recipes — we also use it to organize all of our grocery shopping. And it is really simple: fill in the meal planner, transfer the meals to the shopping list, and just like that, we reduce trips to the store and stay completely organized.

But there’s one catch: many of our recipes date back to our pre-kid days and are designed for just two portions. Mealie does support temporary scaling of ingredient quantities, but it would be so much nicer if the default ingredient amounts could be permanently adjusted. Right now, there’s no built-in feature in Mealie to make that kind of permanent scaling quick and easy. 🤓

So, let's hack and voilà: this small HTML tool was born to help us quickly and conveniently scale ingredients without doing the math ourselves.
